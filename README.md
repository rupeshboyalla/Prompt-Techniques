This course focuses on prompting best practices for instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs), emphasizing how developers can effectively use LLM APIs to build real-world applications.
🔑 Core Prompting Techniques Covered
Clear & Specific Instructions️ Instructions
Treat the LLM like a capable assistant with no task context. Clearly define:
What you want
Scope and focus
Tone and style
Intended audience
Instruction-Tuned Prompting
Prefer instruction-tuned LLMs over base models. These models are optimized to:
Follow explicit instructions
Be more helpful, honest, and safe
Produce predictable, task-aligned outputs
Contextual Prompting
Provide relevant background or reference text to guide the model, similar to giving a human assistant reading material before assigning a task.
Task Decomposition
Break down requests into well-defined actions (e.g., summarize, infer, transform, expand) to improve output quality and reliability.
Tone & Format Control
Explicitly specify:
Writing style (professional, casual, journalistic, etc.)
Output structure (bullets, paragraphs, concise answers)
“Give the Model Time to Think”
Encourage reasoning by structuring prompts that allow step-by-step thinking, especially for complex tasks.
